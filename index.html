        You'll start your Ethiopian adventure with a tour of the nation's capital.
        Your Addis Ababa tour will include a visit to the National Museum as well as the historic Trinity Cathedral to soak in the nation's fascinating Christian history.
        Another highlight of your day is sure to be the chance to take in the city from atop Mount Entoto.
        
        You'll then overnight in the capital.

         You'll set off after breakfast and board your scheduled flight to Axum (sometimes known as Aksum), the site of some of Ethiopia's most storied ruins.
          Upon arrival, you'll check into your hotel before venturing out to the Northern Stelae field to see the 4th century obelisks that lend the region its name. 
          While all of the tombs excavated so far have been robbed centuries ago, more than 90% of the ancient burial sites remain unearthed!
          You'll then proceed to St. Mary's of Zion Cathedral, fabled home of the Ark of the Covenant. Not only is this4th century church said to be home to the Biblical artefact, it is also where ancient Axum Emperors and Empresses were crowned.
          A visit to the archaeological museum will further enhance your knowledge of the ancient kingdom.

         Bathed in the history of the Ancient Kingdom of Axum, you'll overnight nearby.

         After breakfast, you'll set off for the airport for your scheduled flight to Lalibela.

        The famous rock-hewn churches of Lalibela are undoubtedly one of Ethiopia's most recognisable attractions, and stand as testament to the ancient nation's devout belief.
         after checking into your hotel, you'll visit two sets of rock-hewn churches, including those connected by underground passages and the most famous of all - Bet Giyorgis (St. George).
         these ancient churches date from the 7th through 13th century, and showcase Ethiopia's roots as one of Christianity's founding nations.

         You'll overnight nearby in your selected accommodation.

       <p>
         You'll set off for Gondar after breakfast, boarding your flight and traveling forward in time to the 17th century.
         Often known as the 'Camelot of Africa', Gondar's impressive castles and surrounding historic sites show a remarkable fusion of European and African medieval sensibilities.
         Where most of Ethiopia's most famous landmarks have close Christian ties, Gondar finds its roots in Ethiopia's early Jewish population.
         Fasil Ghebbi, the Royal Enclosure, is the most impressive site in Gondar, but you'll also pay a visit to other local landmarks such as the Bath of King Fasildas and the breathtaking Debre Berhan Selassie Church.
         
         Once your day of historic exploration is complete, you'll overnight nearby.

       <p>
         You'll depart after breakfast for the drive to Bahir Dar, affectionately known as Ethiopia's Riveria due to its location on the shores of Lake Tana and the banks of the Blue Nile.
         after checking into your hotel, you'll drive to the Blue Nile Falls for a spectacular view of the river's awesome power.

         You'll dine and overnight in Bahir Dar.

         After breakfast, you'll set out for a morning boat cruise on the waters of Lake Tana. Like so much of Ethiopia, this region is steeped in history.
         lake Tana is known as the Source of the Blue Nile, but is also home to a number of islands that house 13th century monasteries every bit as intriguing as Gondar and Axum.
         You'll visit the monastery of Ura Kidane Mehret as well as the island monastery of Entos before boarding your afternoon flight back to Addis Ababa.
